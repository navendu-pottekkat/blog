“And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.” - Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore

I started reading Murakami books with his collection of short stories, “The Elephant Vanishes”. Intrigued by his writing, touching alternate worlds with the plausible everyday life nudged me to read one of his most famous novels, “Kafka on the Shore”.

Like in most Murakami novels, the book transports you to this magical alternative universe that he had created with his vivid descriptions and  surreal characters. 

The plot revolves around the two characters Kafka and Nakata whose stories converge as the book unravels. The 15 year old Kafka, leaves his home from his father, a famous sculptor, with a carefully packed backpack to escape from a ghastly prophecy. Whereas Nakata is an old man in his 60s- who gained an unusual power to talk with cats from a childhood accident, robbing him of his memory and ability to read- who lives on his government subsidy and small earnings from tracking lost cats.

These seemingly disconnected characters are put into a surreal adventure with fish raining from the sky, soldiers unaged since the World War and love sick ghosts which string together to form a beautiful, dreamlike masterpiece.
